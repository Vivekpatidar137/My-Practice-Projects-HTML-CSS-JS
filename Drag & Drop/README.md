# Drag & Drop Using JavaScript

This project demonstrates a simple drag-and-drop interface using JavaScript, allowing users to move items between two boxes. The project showcases how to implement drag-and-drop functionality with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Drag & Drop**: Users can drag items from one container and drop them into another.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and adjusts for different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the drag-and-drop interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the containers and draggable items.
- **JavaScript**: For adding drag-and-drop functionality.

## Usage

1. Open the app in a web browser.
2. Drag any item from the left box and drop it into the right box.
3. Drag items back to the left box as needed.

## Files

- **index.html**: Main HTML file containing the app structure.
- **style.css**: CSS file for styling the containers and draggable items.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file for handling the drag-and-drop events.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure the images are placed in the `icons` folder.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the drag-and-drop functionality in action.

## Code Modifications

This project is inspired by a tutorial from the YouTube channel "GreatStack." During development, I encountered an issue with the original code that resulted in the error: 
`"Uncaught TypeError: Node.appendChild: Argument 1 is not an object."` 
I modified the code structure to resolve this error and successfully implemented the drag-and-drop functionality.

## Responsive Design

- The layout adjusts based on screen size, stacking the containers vertically on smaller screens for better usability.
