                    <p>In space, time is measured the same way it is on Earth, but it can be affected by gravity and
                        velocity. The closer an object is to a massive body like a planet, the stronger its
                        gravitational pull, which can cause time to appear to slow down.</p>

                    <p>
                        Life on Earth is a diverse collection of living organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, and
                        microorganisms. It has evolved over millions of years in response to a changing environment and
                        has adapted to a wide range of habitats, from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains.

                    <p>
                        The sun is a type of star known as a G-type main-sequence star, or G dwarf star, and is
                        relatively small and cool compared to other stars. It is estimated to be about 4.6 billion years
                        old and has another 5 billion years or so left in its lifecycle before it begins to evolve into
                        a red giant and eventually cools down into a white dwarf.
