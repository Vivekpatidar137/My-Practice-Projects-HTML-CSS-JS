# The Cosmic Explorers Website

## Features

- **Responsive Navigation**: A fully responsive navigation bar with a hamburger menu for smaller screens.
- **Dynamic Content**: The site includes interactive elements, such as a collapsible "See More" section for additional information.

## API Integration

The project utilizes the NASA API to fetch and display real-time data about space. The integration involves making asynchronous API calls using JavaScript and dynamically updating the DOM to reflect the fetched data.

### Key API Features

- **NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)**: Fetches and displays the daily astronomy picture from NASA's APOD API.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the content of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling the website to make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity and handling API calls.
- **NASA API**: Fetching real-time space data.

## JavaScript Functionality

- **Asynchronous API Calls**: Using `fetch` to make requests to the NASA API and handling responses.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updating the web page content based on API responses.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the site is mobile-friendly and accessible on various devices.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cosmic-explorers.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd cosmic-explorers
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the website.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement asynchronous JavaScript for API calls.
- Utilize the NASA API to fetch and display space-related data.
- Enhance skills in DOM manipulation and responsive web design.
