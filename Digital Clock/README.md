- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts seamlessly for different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent look on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Time Labels**: Displays hours, minutes, and seconds with respective labels for clarity.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the clock.
- **CSS**: For styling the clock and adding animation effects.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching and updating the time every second.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The digital clock will display the current time with a dynamic background animation.

## Files

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the digital clock.
- **style.css**: Styles the clock with animations and responsive design.
- **script.js**: Manages the time updates using JavaScript.

## Code Explanation

### HTML Structure

- **Clock Container**: A container that holds the clock display, consisting of hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Labels**: Each time unit (hours, minutes, seconds) includes a label for clarity.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the digital clock in action.

## Notes

- Ensure that the `style.css` and `script.js` files are correctly linked in the HTML file.
- The clock will update automatically every second, thanks to the JavaScript `setInterval` function.
